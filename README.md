# Emerging Reality 
- is a term I use to describe a method for compiling diverse media streams into a hardware assisted tool for altering consciousness prior to the application of therapies used to mitigate certain psychological conditions like addiction or depression. Kind of like an Ayahuasca preprocessor. 
- the resulting VR and Mixed Reality datasets are viewed in a high end room-size VR headset like the HTC Vive.
- This project also develops code to extend the current positional limitations of the Vive lighthouses to extend the room dimensions along one axis, creating a long corridor rather than a square "play area".

Look for more information on my blog at http://worldwins.net.
